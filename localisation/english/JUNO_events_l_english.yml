JUNO_brazil_news.6.d: "The ongoing turmoil in [BRA.GetNonIdeologyName] has spiraled out of control in recent days, leading to a communist coup. The government had thwarted a plot by the communist movement to overthrow the regime in 1935, but they failed to stem the greater red tide. While much of the military has remained loyal to the central government, many lower ranking officers are siding with the communists. Many in the region are concerned that a communist [BRA.GetNonIdeologyName] will trigger a domino effect across the continent of South America."
