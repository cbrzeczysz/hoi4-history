  AAT_nordic_shared.1.b: "This sounds too dangerous, we had better stay out" 
  AAT_nordic_shared.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] Proposes Mutual Guarantees"
  AAT_nordic_shared.2.desc: "As tensions rise across the world, finding trustworthy allies has become more and more difficult. The [FROM.GetAdjective] government is proposing that, as fellow Nordic countries, we announce to the world that [ROOT.GetName] and [FROM.GetName] will stand for each other in case of a foreign invasion. Are we comfortable committing to this?"
  AAT_nordic_shared.2.a: "It might be the only way to survive"
  AAT_nordic_shared.2.b: "We won't let them drag us with them"
  AAT_nordic_shared.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] will stand with us!"
  AAT_nordic_shared.3.desc: "We have received news that the [FROM.GetAdjective] people will defend [ROOT.GetName]'s independence, and we in turn will defend theirs. Nordic countries must be ready to repel any invasion as a united force instead of disparate small nations."
  AAT_nordic_shared.3.a: "Great news!"
  AAT_nordic_shared.4.t: "Our proposition has been rejected by [FROM.GetName]"
  AAT_nordic_shared.4.desc: "Centuries of history together doesn't seem to have much sway in persuading the [FROM.GetAdjective] government that our people must stand together against foreign tyrants. Let's hope they change their mind before it's too late."
  AAT_nordic_shared.4.a: "Sad news"
  
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has crossed the line!"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.1.desc: "Time and time again, we have found evidence that our war efforts against [?GLOBAL.NORDIC_country_to_defend.GetName] have been hindered by [FROM.GetName]'s surreptitious support. \n\nPerhaps is time to teach them a lesson on how to wage war the real way."

  AAT_nordic_cooperation.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] offers their help in our war efforts"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.2.desc: "In these treacherous times, the bonds that tie us to [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] have been invaluable. They've provided their support in our war against [?NORDIC_attacker.GetName], and now they're willing to go the extra mile and have offered to join the defense of our country. After all, an attack on one of us, is an attack on all the Nordic Nations."
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.2.a: "Their help is welcome"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.2.b: "We can deal with this without them"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejected Our Offer to Help"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.3.desc: "Despite our best intentions it seems [FROM.GetNameDef] doesn't need or want our help. Only they know the reasoning behind this puzzling decision.\n\nThis doesn't mean we have to stop supporting them in other ways, or that [?FROM.NORDIC_attacker.GetName] can decide to consider us a belligerent."

  AAT_nordic_cooperation.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Seeks Investments"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.4.desc: "Our Nordic neighbors have sent a delegation seeking investments to further develop their economy. This will definitely be beneficial for our industrial sector too, but we should make sure we're supporting a friendly neighbor instead of a potential enemy. "

  AAT_nordic_cooperation.4.b: "It's not worth the risk"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.5.t: "[FROM.GetName]'s Investments Are Now Rolling In"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.5.desc: "Our Nordic neighbors have been gracious enough to accept our invitation to invest in our economy. They will of course be rewarded for their trust, but more importantly, it will allow our economy to grow at a faster pace."
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.5.a: "Great news!"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.6.t: "[FROM.GetName] Declined To Invest In Our Economy"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.6.desc: "Despite our best efforts, we couldn't convince our Nordic neighbors to help us further develop our economy. We can always try again with another country, of course."
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.6.a: "Unfortunate"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.7.t: "[FROM.GetName] Seeks Economic Cooperation"
  AAT_nordic_cooperation.7.desc: "Our Nordic neighbors want to find common ground in order to establish a mutually beneficial treaty for economic and industrial cooperation. If done properly, as we hope it will be, this will boost both our economies equally, as we would enter it as equals.\n\nGiven our region's historic ebb and flow of enmity, we must be wary of benefiting a future rival, if they were to turn their back on us."

  AAT_norway.1.desc: "While the contentious revolutionary was out on a fishing trip with his host, fascists connected to the Nasjonal Samling party broke into Konrad Knudsen's home, where Trotskij was staying.\n\nThe burglars were looking for any incriminating evidence that would justify getting rid of the exiled communist, but they were fortunately scared off the property by Knudsen's daughter, Hjørdis, before they could grab anything of significance."
  AAT_norway.1.a: "He must be kept away from trouble"
  AAT_norway.1.b: "We could kill two birds with one stone"
  AAT_norway.1.c: "Give this man an office!"
  AAT_norway.1.d: "His past is all the evidence we need, jail him!"
  
  AAT_norway.2.t: "Trotskij Under House Arrest at a Farm"
  AAT_norway.2.desc: "Citing a breach of the agreement to avoid political participation during his exile, and the flimsy evidence the fascist burglars stole, we have sent [NOR_lev_trotsky.GetName] on his way to a farm in Hurum, where he will be under police watch and kept isolated from the outside world.\n\nIt's a harsh punishment, but pressures from [SOU.GetNameDef] and local fascists make him a dangerous rallying point."
  AAT_norway.2.a: "It's the best we can do for now"
  
  AAT_norway.3.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader.GetName]'s general crackdown on dissent"
  AAT_norway.3.desc: "After the altercation at Knudsen's villa, it became clear that the political situation is fraught with peril thanks to Communists and Fascists being at each other's throats.\n\nThe bickering and political turmoil must be dealt with. Trotskij's presence risks bringing the ire of the [SOU.GetNameDef] upon us and at the same time, the Nasjonal Samling is sure to hand over the country to [FGR.GetLeader] at the first opportunity, so their influence needs to be curtailed at any cost.\n\nThe best course of action is sending him to Mexico, where [MEX.GetLeader] has agreed to allow him into the country."
  AAT_norway.3.a: "This is for the survival of Norway"
  
  AAT_norway.4.t: "Trotskij joins our government!"
  AAT_norway.4.desc: "The solution to the [NOR.GetAdjective] people's woes was right under our noses. [NOR_lev_trotsky.GetName] is not only one of the greatest Marxist writers of our time, but also a charismatic revolutionary and an outstanding general.\n\nThis will certainly cause some tension with [SOV.GetNameDef], but it will be worth it. After all, his experience can lead our young nation, and the workers of Scandinavia to greatness."
  AAT_norway.4.a: "One nation's exile is another one's savior!"
  
  AAT_norway.5.t: "[NOR_lev_trotsky.GetName] imprisoned!"
  AAT_norway.5.desc: "Others may call the evidence found in Knudsen's home flimsy, inconsequential or even fabricated, and they could be right, but perhaps at some point, under certain circumstances a judge will accept its validity. Besides, the fact remains that we cannot risk alienating the Nasjonal Samling at this moment. This is why [NOR_lev_trotsky.GetName] has been put into custody, effective immediately.\n\nWhen, or how, he will see the light of day again is a matter of little importance at the moment, but we will make sure he at least has better accommodation than he had in Siberia."
  AAT_norway.5.a: "He had to be stopped"
  
  AAT_norway.6.t: "The Fate of Trotskij"
  AAT_norway.6.desc: "It's been some time since we put [NOR_lev_trotsky.GetName] in house arrest in a farm in Hurum, and it does not seem to be a good arrangement for any party involved. [SOV.GetNameDefCap] wants extradition, the Nasjonal Samling wants him hanged, and everyone else who is not a die-hard trotskyist wants him out. We need to decide what to do with this troublesome exile.\n\nThe Mexican President [MEX.GetLeader] has offered to take him in if we choose to let him continue his exile, but we could also just send him to [SOV.GetLeader] as a token of friendship."
  AAT_norway.6.a: "He will enjoy the Mexican sunshine"
  AAT_norway.6.b: "Stalin will love us for this!"

  AAT_norway.7.a: "Finally some peace"
  
  AAT_norway.8.t: "[get_trotsky_lastname] Arrives to Moscow"
  AAT_norway.8.desc_SOV: "We have dreamed of this moment for years. The treacherous snake [SOV_lev_trotsky.GetName] is in our possession. He will pay for his crimes against The Revolution, and most importantly, against comrade Stalin. Not that there is any difference between those in the eyes of the proletariat."
  AAT_norway.8.desc_NOR: "The troublesome former revolutionary [NOR_lev_trotsky.GetName] was taken to Moscow, where he will be contained, or perhaps executed depending on [SOU.GetLeader]'s whims.\n\nRegardless of his fate, we can finally wash our hands off this lengthy affair, with the added benefit of growing closer to [SOU.GetNameDef]."

  AAT_norway.9.t: "Nygaardsvold's Cabinet"
  AAT_norway.9.desc: "The government led by the Labor Party, with [NOR_johan_nygaardsvold.GetName] at the helm, is the first stable government with a clear majority our young nation has ever had. The cabinet has been hard at work for the past year, pushing for measures that, albeit slowly, will help [NOR.GetName] come out of the deep economic crisis the country is in right now, securing the welfare of the people living in it.\n\nOf course, these measures come of at the cost of any military preparations we might need should we found ourselves enveloped by war. We can only hope these won't be needed."
  AAT_norway.9.a: "Only peace and stability ahead!"
  
  AAT_norway.10.t: "The Storting Stumbles"
  AAT_norway.10.desc: "As war in Europe looms ever more inevitable, the [NOR.GetAdjective] parliament, or Storting, is rocked by waves of chaos and discord. The indications that the Nygaardsvold cabinet would bring forth an era of stability are long forgotten, as members of parliament can't seem to agree on any coherent measure to steer [NOR.GetName] safely through the coming storm.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemies of the people sharpen their knives to feast on the strife, growing until [NOR.GetName] is consumed by the flames of war."

  AAT_norway.12.t: "No Confidence Vote Against Johan Nygaardsvold"
  AAT_norway.12.desc: "Despite its early promise, it seems the government that Johan Nygaardsvold formed last year was not only failing to deliver, but was also hell-bent on disarming. Many members of the parliament believed that [ROOT.GetName] should develop its industry in a way that allows for investing in the fledgling [NOR.GetAdjective] armed forces, with the intent of deterring a foreign power from invading.\n\nAnd so, a vote of no confidence was triggered by members of the conservative party, Høyre. Though its chairman, the industrialist Johan H. Andresen was already thinking about retiring, he's seized the opportunity to lead Norway in a new direction; presenting himself as the pragmatic and efficient alternative to Nygaardsvold's social progress dreams."
  AAT_norway.12.a: "Nygaardsvold is out, Andresen is in"

  AAT_norway.13.desc: "While we were busy moving our economy forward and keeping a watchful eye over the fascists abroad, we allowed domestic fascism to fester, right under our noses. Despite his diminishing base of support and his party, the Nasjonal Samling, never achieving a single seat in the storting, Vidkun Quisling formed a [?NOR.NOR_cw_fascist_attacker.GetAdjective]-backed government, and claims to have seized the levers of power in [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName]."

Once settled, he will pave the way of our invasion and legitimize the [ROOT.GetAdjective] occupation of [NOR.GetName]."
  AAT_norway.14.a: "He will be useful"

  AAT_norway.15.desc: "Despite our best efforts, Vidkun Quisling has launched his attempt to seize power in Oslo. With support from the invading fascists, he is broadcasting his proclamation of a new government, dedicated to collaboration with our enemies.\n\nThere is no way to dress this, we were losing before and this coup will only exacerbate our war efforts."

  AAT_norway.17.desc_denmark: "A courtier from King Haakon VII of Norway, or as we once knew him, Prince Carl of Denmark, has approached us with a serious demand.

AAT_britain_narvik.1.desc: "We have successfully blown up the [SWE.GetAdjective] mines and robbed [GER.GetNameDef] of one of its most important import resource. Despite the promise of aid to [FIN.GetName] as the prime motivation for this endeavor, it was never really a viability to engage in direct conflict with [SOV.GetNameDef] and we have dealt a major blow to our main adversary.

The most likely explanation for this is that the [ENG.GetAdjective] troops are trying to reach the mines in Gällivare and Kiruna to sabotage them in order to prevent the high grade ore from reaching [GER.GeName], which would be a huge blow to the both [GER.GetAdjective] and [SWE.GetAdjective] economies and a huge breach of [SWE.GetAdjective] neutrality."

A key economic engine of the [SWE.GetAdjective] economy is now but a ruined quarry. The [ENG.GetAdjective] government has defended their actions by arguing that trading with [GER.GetNameDefCap] is just as bad as siding with them, and that the actions are justified, but it seems that even their domestic population is uncomfortable with their governments explanation."

Its government also reiterates that it has no real enmity towards the [SWE.GetAdjective] state, and that its action in [SWE.GetName] is purely in the interest of the defense of democracy. Both the [GER.GetAdjective] and [SWE.GetAdjective] embassy has delivered a letter of protest, the [GER.GetAdjective] side arguing that [ENG.GetName] breached neutrality and invaded a foreign nation in a combat zone, and [SWE.GetAdjective] lambasting the [ENG.GetAdjective] government that despite its lofty goals of helping [FIN.GetName] it is now clear that it was a poorly constructed ploy to achieve their own ends, an the cost of [SWE.GetAdjective] lives."
